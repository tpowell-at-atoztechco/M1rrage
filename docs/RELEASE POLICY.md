# M1rrage Release Policy
M1rrage's Release Policy is specific to the channel it is being released to. This is primarily designed to ensure that M1rrage development and updates are smooth and stable, and don't interfere with end-user operability, but also facilitate the thourough and complete development of individual features.
- Master/Trunk: The primary development branch where updates to M1rrage are merged. This is where ongoing work on M1rrage is usually done and is the source of the latest development features.
- Experimental: For extensions or features that are still under development or testing phases. These builds might include new functionality that hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, but should be stable for general use.
- Stable: Have been tested and are considered stable for use. These versions are recommended for production use where reliability is important.
- Snapshot: M1rrage release snapshots of the codebase at a particular moment, useful for those who want to test specific states of the extension without waiting for an official release.
- Community: M1rrage releases on this channel might be user-contributed or maintained by the community. These are often found in repositories or as unofficial builds, where stability might vary.
