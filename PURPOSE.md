# M1rrage Mission Statement
"Empowering Legacy Machines with Cutting-Edge Software: M1rrage is dedicated to advancing the potential of legacy systems by providing an open-source ARM64 emulation platform that bridges the gap between historic hardware and modern software innovations."

# Explanation of Purpose
Purpose of M1rrage:
M1rrage is designed to address the challenge of running modern ARM64 software on legacy machines. As technology evolves, new software often requires advanced architectures that older systems cannot natively support. M1rrage aims to overcome this limitation by offering a robust, open-source ARM64 emulation platform that enables legacy hardware to run contemporary applications.

Key Objectives:

- <b>Preserve Legacy Systems</b>: By enabling legacy machines to run modern ARM64 software, M1rrage helps preserve the value and functionality of older hardware that might otherwise become obsolete.

- <b>Facilitate Software Transition</b>: M1rrage serves as a bridge between new software technologies and existing hardware, making it easier for users to transition to cutting-edge applications without needing to invest in new equipment.

- <b>Foster Innovation</b>: As an open-source project, M1rrage encourages collaboration and innovation within the developer community. By making the source code freely available, M1rrage invites contributions that enhance its capabilities and adapt it to new use cases.

- <b>Enable Access to Advanced Features</b>: M1rrage allows users of legacy machines to benefit from the latest advancements in ARM64 software, ensuring that even older systems can access state-of-the-art features and improvements.

- <b>Promote Educational and Research Opportunities</b>: M1rrage provides a valuable tool for educational and research institutions by allowing them to experiment with ARM64 software on legacy hardware, facilitating learning and exploration in the fields of emulation and software development.

M1rrage’s commitment to supporting legacy hardware through innovative emulation technology not only extends the useful life of older systems but also democratizes access to the latest software advancements, making cutting-edge technology more accessible to a broader audience.
# Inspiration
Several notable figures have commented on the idea that everything can be represented or computed by machines, reflecting the broader concept that computers have the potential to model complex systems or perform any calculation. Here are a few key quotes related to this concept and that motivate us to develop M1rrage:

- Alan Turing:
  "We may call it a universal machine if it is intended to carry out any computation which can be described in advance. ... The idea is that a machine can be made to execute any conceivable operation, provided that it is specified by a finite set of instructions."
  This quote reflects Turing's foundational idea of the universal Turing machine, which is capable of simulating any other Turing machine. Turing’s concept underpins modern computer science and the notion that a single machine can, in theory, perform any computable task.
- John von Neumann:
  "The computer is the most remarkable tool we have, able to accomplish anything we can describe or conceive."
  Von Neumann, a pioneer in computer architecture, highlighted the computer's versatility and power in executing a wide range of tasks as long as they can be described in terms of algorithms.
- Marshall McLuhan:
  "The medium is the message."
  While not directly about computation, McLuhan’s quote emphasizes how the medium of communication (in this case, computers) shapes and influences the content and processes, reflecting how computers transform and mediate our interaction with information.
- Donald D. Knuth:
  "The computer is a tool that can be used to solve problems, and it will always be used in ways that are limited only by the imagination of its users."
  Knuth, a renowned computer scientist, underscores the idea that the scope of what computers can achieve is bounded by the creativity and vision of their users.
- Richard Hamming:
  "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."
  Hamming’s quote highlights the idea that the ultimate goal of computing is to gain understanding and insight, not merely to process data or perform calculations.
  
These quotes reflect a broader understanding of computers as powerful, versatile tools capable of performing a vast array of tasks, limited primarily by the creativity and imagination of those who use them.
